# Talestolen src merge report

This combined `src/` uses the LAN iteration as the base and overlays tab-related files from the tabs iteration.

Heuristic rules:
- Prefer LAN (webrtc/LiveSync/datachannel) files from the LAN base.
- Prefer tab/router/navigation files from the Tabs source.
- On ambiguous conflicts, LAN file is kept and the Tabs variant is saved next to it with `.tabs-variant` suffix so you can diff locally.

## Summary

- New files from Tabs added: 0
- Updated files where Tabs replaced LAN: 0
- Conflicts saved as both: 1

## New (from Tabs):
